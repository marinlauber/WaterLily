# Getting Started

## Installation requirements

WaterLily.jl is tested and can run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS, it is written exclusively in Julia and it only depends on registered Julia packages.

## Installation

WaterLily.jl is a registered package. Thus, the installation should be straight forward using the Julia's package manager [Pkg](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/). To this end, open the Julia REPL (i.e., execute the `julia` binary), type `]` to enter package mode, and install WaterLily.jl as follows

```julia
pkg> add WaterLily
```

That's all.

For further information about how to install and manage Julia packages, see the
[Pkg documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/).

## Further steps

We recommend to follow the [WaterLily.jl Examples](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily-Examples) in order to get familiar with the solver.
